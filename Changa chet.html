      <h2><font color="red"><em>Dashain in Nepal</h2></em></font>
     <p>Dashain commemorates a great victory of the gods over the wicked demons.<br>One of the victory stories told is the Ramayan, where the lord Ram after a big<br>struggle slaughtered Ravana, the fiendish king of demons. It is said<br>that lord Ram was successful in the battle only when goddess Durga was evoked.<br>The main celebration glorifies the triumph of good over evil and is<br>symbolized by goddess Durga slaying the terrible demon Mahisasur, who terrorised<br>the earth in the guise of a brutal water buffalo. The first nine days<br>signify the nine days of ferrous battle between goddess Durga and the demon Mahisasur.<br>The tenth day is the day when Mahisasur was slain and the<br>last five days symbolise the celebration of the victory with the blessing of the goddess.<br>Dashain is celebrated with great rejoice, and goddess Durga<br>is worshiped throughout the kingdom as the divine mother goddess.In preparation for Dashain<br>every home is cleansed and beautifully decorated, painted as an invitation to the mother goddess, so<br>that she may visit and bless the house with good<br>fortune. During this time the reunion of distant and nearby relatives occur in every household.<br>The market is filled with shoppers seeking new clothing, gifts,<br>luxuries and enormous supplies of temple offering for the gods, as well as foodstuffs for the family feasting.<br>Thousands of sheep, goats, ducks, chicken,chicken<br>and water buffalo are prepared for the great slaughter.

Anywhere you go the aroma of 'Vijaya Dashami' is found.<strong>Now lets go see how we celebrate dashain from the first to the last day.</p></strong><br><br>
     <h3>The first day of dashain</h3>

     <p>The first day of Dashain is called Ghatasthapana, which literally means pot establishing.<br>On this day the kalash, (holy water vessel) symbolising goddess Durga often with her image<br>embossed on the side is placed in the prayer room. The kalash is filled with holy water and covered<br>with cowdung on to which seeds are sown.<br>A small rectangular sand block is made and the kalash is put in the centre. The surrounding<br>bed of sand is also seeded with grains. The ghatasthapana ritual is<br>performed at a certain auspicious moment determined by the astrologers. At that particular moment the<br>priest intones a welcome, requesting goddess<br>Durga to bless the vessel with her presence.</p> 
     <h3>The eight day of dashain</h3>

     <p>The eight day is called the Maha Asthami.The fervour of worship and sacrifice to Durga<br>and Kali increases. On this day many orthodox Hindus will be fasting. Sacrifices are held<br>in almost every house through out the day. The night of the eighth day is called 'Kal Ratri',<br>the dark night. Hundreds of goats, sheep and buffaloes are sacrificed at the mother goddess temples.<br>The sacrifice continues till dawn. While the puja is being carried out great feasts are held in the<br>homes of common people where large amount of meat are consumed.</p><br><br>
     <h3>The ninth day</h3>
     <p>The ninth day is called nawami.Temples of mother goddess are filled with people from dawn till dusk.<br>Animals mostly black buffaloes are slaughtered to honour Durga the goddess of victory and might and<br>to seek her blessing. Military bands play war tunes, guns boom and officers with beautifully decorated<br>medals in full uniform stand there. When the function ends the courtyard is filled ankle deep with blood.<br>On this very day the god Vishwa Karma, the God of creativity is also worshiped. All factories, vehicles,<br>any machinery instruments and anything from which we make a living are worshiped. We also give sacrifices<br>to all moving machinery like cars, aeroplanes, trucks etc. to get the blessing from goddess Durga<br>for protection for vehicles and their occupants against accidents during the year. The entire day is colourful.</p><br><br>

     <h3>The tenth day</h3>
     <img src="https://www.visitnepal.com/nepal_information/tika.jpg" align="right" width="25%"/>
     <p>On this day we take tika and jamara from our elders and receive their blessing. We visit our elders in their home and get tika from them while our younger ones come to our home to receive blessing from us. The importance of Dasain also lies in the fact that on this day family members from far off and distant relatives come for a visit as<br>well as to receive tika from the head of the family. This function continues for four days. After four days of rushing around and meeting your relatives Dashain ends on the full moon day, the fifteenth day. In the last day people stay at home and rest. The full moon day is also called 'Kojagrata' meaning 'who is awake'. The Hindu goddess of<br>wealth Laxmi is worshipped. On this day the goddess Laxmi is given an invitation to visit each and everyone.<br><br>After Dashain everyone settles back to normal. After receiving the blessing of goddess Durga, people are ready to work and acquire virtue, power and wealth. Dashain thus is not only the longest festival but also the most anticipated one among all the festivals of Nepal.</p>
